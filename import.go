/*
To get blobs, already tried:
1) gcs with google.golang.org/cloud/storage -> getting a 403. Plus that wouldn't work anyway
as the blobs don't seem to be in the bucket when I ls with gsutil.
2) oauth2 with code.google.com/p/goauth2/oauth + GET on /resource -> getting redirected.
3) oauth2 with github.com/golang/oauth2 + GET on /resource -> same thing.
4) oauth with github.com/garyburd/go-oauth/oauth -> getting a 400, but maybe I half-assed it.
5) went back to github.com/golang/oauth2, and added X-AppEngine-User-Email header -> not better.
6) go doc hinted at the problem: there's still a login: required in app.yaml, that oauth does not override. need to test and confirm (that we're ok without it).
7) back to approach in 1): was getting 403 because GCS JSON API was needed too. Getting 404s now.
But looked through API explorer at https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/storage/v1/storage.objects.list
which shows same as with gsutil, i.e. not my files. So probably no go that way.
8) back to 6).
